A simple readme on:

- If you need to build anything (Example: grunt)
No need for build, all just plain JS, CSS and HTML.
Must run at browser from local file system with running local server 
(internet connection needed for CDN usage).

- How to start your application (Example: node.js server startup script)
To start local server you can use:
python -m http.server 8000
from the command line in the terminal
from the 'code' directory or
./veryBasicWebserver.py
Then 'index.html' supposed to be opened and show landing page.

- How to execute your unit tests, and where the results are shown
No tests are currently included.

- Any known issues
'simple_NodeJS_Web_Server.js' does not work as proper server
(added for demo purpose only).
Do not use it to launch application.
No (any) good test coverage, but 
work as expected in my local enviroment.
