the link to a live site of my project:

crossover-ci-code-angular.netlify.com

(Herokuapp is great for this)

- Sorry, no Heroku link is currently included.
I have my 
'play-started-on-heroku' -> 'http://play-started-on-heroku.herokuapp.com/'
and 
'scala-started-on-heroku' -> 'http://scala-started-on-heroku.herokuapp.com/'
tutorials deployed.
But this is all for now.
